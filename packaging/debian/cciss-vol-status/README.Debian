README.Debian for cciss-vol-status package
------------------------------------------

Possible configuration:
----------------------

If you want to change the default configuration of the init script you
can create the file /etc/default/cciss-vol-statusd and specify the following
values.

MAILTO=
PERIOD=
REMIND=
ID=

Use MAILTO to specify which user shall get the status mails 
(default is root).

With PERIOD you can fix the seconds between each check.

And REMIND specifies the seconds between each reminder.

ID is set as default to /dev/cciss/c0d0 which should fit most of setups.
However you need to change it to support multiple cards.
Look at the cciss-vol-status(8) manpage for more information.
