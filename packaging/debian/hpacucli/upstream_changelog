Version: 9.10.22.0  (4 Jun 2012)
  Enhancements
    - Added support for the following controllers: 
      * HP Dynamic Smart Array B120i
      * HP Dynamic Smart Array B320i
      * HP Smart Array P822
    - Now officially supporting and providing native X64 versions in addition
      to existing 32 bit versions
    - Added new features requiring a valid SAAP 2.0 (Smart Array Advanced Pack) license key:
      * Replace Array:
        Allows the transfer of contents of an array to an existing empty
        array or a new array. All logical drives from the source array will
        be transferred. The original array will be deleted and its data
        drives  will be freed as unassigned drives. The drive types at source
        and destination arrays can be different. This allows moving data from
        SATA to SAS, or SAS to SATA.  However, the drive types comprising the
        array must still be of the same type.
      * Heal Array:
        Allows the replacement of failed or degraded physical drives in an
        array with healthy physical drives. The original array and logical
        drive numbering will be unaffected after the replacement. The
        replacement physical drives must be of the same interface type (such
        as SAS, SATA and etc.) as the original drives. The operation will be
        available only if enough unassigned physical drives of the correct
        size are available.

Version: 8.75-12.0  (22 Jun 2011)
  Enhancements
    - *** New ***
      Starting with versions 8.75.12.0, an Offline version of ACU is
      available from http://www.hp.com/ that allows users to boot directly
      into the configuration and maintenance utilities prior to any Host OS
      loading or being installed.
      .
      This new deliverable of ACU is available for download through normal
      software methods (such as searching by Server model, OS, or device) or
      by searching for 'HP ProLiant Offline Array Configuration Utility'
    - SmartSSD Wear Gauge
      This feature is accessible through the ssdinfo command in ACUCLI
      Example code:
        <target> show ssdinfo [detail|summary]
        Provides a summary for solid state drives for the specified controller(s)
        The target can be any valid controller/device
        controller slot=1 show sddinfo
        controller all show ssdinfo
        controller all show ssdinfo detail
        controller all show ssdinfo summary
    - Greater than 2.2 TB Hard Drives

Version: 8.70-8.0  (11 Mar 2011)
  Enhancements
    - Improved speed of Diagnostic report generation
    - Supported serial logs included in the zip file of the Diagnositc
      reports, when applicable
    - New options available during creation of logical drive size
    - Now showing current and max temperatures for physical drives
    - Support for failed array controllers.  The "ctrl all show" command will
      list any locked up controllers along with valid controllers. For failed
      controllers, a message will display explaining its state along with a
      lockup code, if applicable
    - Support for "-h" and "-help" commandline option
    - HPACUSCRIPTING updates:
      * Will not display array accelerator info in capture files for
        controllers which do not have cache or the cache is not configurable.
        Attempting to set the array accelerator on these controllers will
        result in a warning message (not an error)
      * Support for logical drive command "Size=MAXMBR". This option creates
        the largest possible volume in an array with the maximum size
        constrained by the limits of the 32bit MBR
      * New keyword, SIZEBLOCKS. Input scripts can now specify size as before
        using SIZE (size in MB) or SIZEBLOCKS (size in 512 byte blocks) but
        not both
      * Now displays the disk interface type in the comment section for physical
        disks.

Version: 8.61-1.0  (8 Feb 2011)
  Fixes
    - In version 8.60-8.0 of HPACUCLI, using the "show or detail commands" on
      any target that includes physical drives can cause the application to
      exit if one or more of the included physical drives are in a failed
      state.
      This release, 8.61-1.0, corrects this problem and allows the command to
      complete successfully.

Version: 8.60-8.0  (10 Sep 2010)
  Enhancements

      discretion
    - Diagnostic Report additions:
      * Parity group information for RAID 50 and RAID 60 logical drives
      * Information for SEP devices and Expanders
      * Updated Storage Enclosure names
    - Applicable only with the appropriate SAAP License Key installed:
      * The Move Array operation now allows the user to move an array to
        physical drives that are smaller than the original physical drives,
        provided that all the data in the existing logical drives will fit
        into the new array
          * The new drive set must have the same number of physical drives as
            the existing drive set
    - Added SEP devices and Expanders to "ctrl slot=X show config" and "ctrl
      slot=X show config detail" commands
    - Added an "OS Status" for logical drives to indicate if it is "locked"
      by the OS
    - Added display of Hardware Revision info for SAS Expander boards
      * "<target> enclosure all show detail" should be used in order to see
        the field displayed
    - Added support for being able to run ACUCLI in non-interactive mode for
      read-only commands (show) even if ACU is running. For example:
        # hpacucli ctrl all show
        # hpacucli ctrl slot=1 pd all show status
    - Added "exitonerror" feature which allows the application to exit upon
      encountering any error during execution of a command. This feature is
      useful for scripts invoking ACUCLI and the feature will allow scripts
      to know that an error has occurred.
        * The setting can also be invoked from the console as an application switch
          Example:  "hpacucli -exitonerror < myscript.txt"
        * set [exitonerror=enable|disable]
          Allows a script to decide whether an error encountered during execution
        * show exitonerror
          Displays the current exitonerror setting 
     - Added enclosure show support
       * enclosure [ all | port:box | serialnumber=xxxx ] show [ detail |
         status]
         Outputs the storage enclosure information The target can be any
         valid storage enclosure
         Examples:
           * controller slot=5 enclosure all show
           * controller slot=5 enclosure 4E:1 show detail
           * controller slot=5 enclosure serialnumber=UAB123456 show status
    - Added support for the 'show' command to display devices in a logical or
      physical format similar to the support in ACU (GUI) 
      * set [view=logical|physical]
        - Allows the user to select whether certain show commands display the
          output using a logical or physical view
        - Logical view displays devices using their association with arrays
        - Physical view displays the devices such as physical drives
          according to their relationship with their storage enclosures
        - The default value is logical view
      * show view
        - Displays the current view setting.
      * Examples:
        set view=physical
        show view
    - Added the capability to run multiple commands in command line mode
      (non-interactive)
      * The semicolon (";") is used as a delimiter between commands
      * For example:
        On LINUX, the semicolon must be escaped or in quotes
        hpacucli "ctrl slot=1 show; ctrl slot=1 modify
        drivewritecache=enable; ctrl slot=1 show"
    - HPACUSCRIPTING Additions:
      * Now shows an expanded usage message when invalid command line
        arguments are provided
      * Added feature to allow RAID=RAID1 for >2 disk mirrors. This 
        allows backwards compatibility with "old" cpqacuxe scripting. Capture
        will still output correct RAID level
      * Added AUTO as a valid option for QUEUEDEPTH
      * Overall Performance improvements
      * Added Controller=FIRST support. Controllers are now sorted in capture
        files in slot ascending order
      * Added additional controller information to errors and warnings to
        better identify where problems occur in an input file
