[DELL: Linux: dellmgr+dellmgr.bin: Ver 5.31: Oct-08-2003: AmitP]
{

  Changes with respect to Ver 5.30 : Oct 03,2003

  CQ Task Id: LSIID100005287

  As per Gerry's suggestion, now the application does not check
  for the size of the physical drive(s), if the user opts for
  CC/Init/Rbld.

  This release is an extension of the previous version for the
  coercion related changes in the application.



  (A) Coercion related issue
  --------------------------
  This release is associated with the following Ids.
  [though may not be directly reported for Megamgr]. The following
  Ids are related to the problems faced due to the coercion issue
  on different applications.

  (1) LSIID100004134
  (2) LSIID100004755
  (3) LSIID100004756
  (4) LSIID100004741


  This release takes care of the Coercion issue related to the
  physical drive size.

  Now the utility gets the drive size based on the following algorithm.

  (1) Fire new f/w cmd 0xA4/0x57 to get the coerced drive size
      from the f/w.

      (a) If the cmd is successful, take the coerced drive size from f/w.
      (b) If the cmd fails, proceed to number (2)

  (2) Get the drive size by firing SCSI Disk Capcacity cmd[0x03/0x25]

  (3) Fire SCSI SEEK cmd[0x03/0x0B] & try to seek 32 sectors beyond
      the drive size returned by (2)

      (a) If SEEK cmd is successful, don't coerce the drive size returned by
          (2)
      (b) If SEEK cmd fails, coerce the drive size returned by (2).


  Note: This is a major change in the application and this needs to be
        tested thoroughly. It will affect all the operations on the
        physical drive(s) and the logical drive(s).

        All options of the utility needs to be thoroughly tested on the
        following types of f/w.

        (A) New F/w with 0xA4/0x57 cmd implemented.
        (B) Old F/w which returns the coerce drive size
        (C) Old F/w which returns uncoerced drive size.

  Thorough testing needs to be done before delivering it to the customer.
  Expect some issues will be present which were not detected by the
  developer.

 (B) As per DELL's change request #LSID10005063, Reconstruction option
     is put back in the dellmgr for Linux also.

     Earlier, this was disabled in Ver 5.28, Apr-29-2003 as per
     DELL's request.


 TESTING PERFORMED:
 ------------------
 Testing done on a 493 card with the following f/w on it.

 (a) New f/w           : 112G
 (b) F/w with coercion
 (c) F/w without coercion.


 File Details:
 -------------
        The release is made as release.gz file.
        release.gz contains the rpm format of the release.

        tar xvfz release.gz will give :

        Dellmgr-5.31-0.i386.rpm

        To install the dellmgr run
        rpm -i Dellmgr-5.31-0.i386.rpm

        This will install dellmgr & dellmgr.bin in the /usr/sbin directory.

 Changes:  With respect to Ver 5.28 : Apr-29-2003
 --------

 There was a debug message present in the previous version of the utility.
 If any IOCTL call failed from the driver side, the debug message was printing
 the same. This was as per the design of the utility as it expected that the
 IOCTL call will never fail.

 With the new driver, if user tried to do random deletion of the logical drive,
 when CC/BI was going on, the IOCTL call failed and this message was being
 printed.

 This never occured at developer level testing as the driver available with
 the developer end(2.3.10-pre1) never failed any IOCTL call.

 This debug message is disabled in this release.


 TESTING PERFORMED:
 ------------------
 Tried to test this at developer's end, but could not be tested as the
 IOCTL call never fails with the said driver version (2.3.10-pre1).
 Please test it thoroughly before releasing it to the customer.


 File Details:

{
 Changes:  With respect to Ver 5.27 : Feb-14-2003
 --------

(1) [#CHNG76013]

    Reconstruction option is no longer supported now in Linux Dellmgr as
    it was incompatible with file system 3.
    This option and it's functionality is removed from the
    "Management Menu"

(2) [#DFCT79146]

    There was a cosmetic issue with the previous version of the utility.
    If the user tried to exit without initializing the newly created
    logical drive(s), the warning message given to the user said

    "..Intialize the logical drive.."
    in place of

    "..Initialize the logical drive.."

    corrected in this release.


(3) [#DFCT56526]

    There was a cosmetic issue with the previous version of the utility.
    After reconstruction, the given message said,

    "Actual size Logical Drive has incresed ..."
    in place of

    "Actual size OF Logical Drive has incresed ..."

    corrected in this release.

    However, this message will not appear in dellmgr, as RECONSTRUCT
    option no longer exists.

(4) [#DFCT81909]

    There was a bug in the previous version of the utility.
    During background init, if the deletion of logical drive failed,
    the utility was closing the device file node.
    Corrected in this release.


(5) [#DFCT82209]

    In the previous version, "Prepare to Remove" option in
    "Objects->Physical Drive" menu was not working as the code
    was found to be disabled since 1999.

    The code is enabled in this release. 

       

 TESTING PERFORMED:
 ------------------
 
 Item no. 1,2 & 3 tested through demo utility & on a 471 card

 Item no. 4 & 5 :
 ---------------
 No testing could be done at developer's end due to lack of
 supporting hardware.

 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 These needs to be tested thoroughly before giving it to the customer.

 Changes:  With respect to Ver 5.26 : Jan-10-2003
 --------

  (1) There was a bug in the previous version of the utility. For getting the
      predictive failure, it was firing 0x65 cmd on 40-ld cards also.

      Predictive failure for 40-ld card is now found out from command
      0xA4/0x0F on 40-ld card, 0x65 cmd for 8-ld card.

      [Defect #DFCT74531]

  (2) If the user tried to fail any configured physical drive manually
      in the physical drive menu, the warning message had a mention of
      R3.

      Corrected in this release. Now it does not mention R3.

      [#CHNG74939]


 TESTING PERFORMED:
 ------------------
 Most of the testing done through demo utility.

 Testing on actual hardware could not be done for change no.1 due to
 lack of supporting hardware.

 Actual testing for remaining changes done on a system with one 471
 card on it.

{
 Changes:  With respect to Ver 5.25 : Oct-25-2002
 --------
        This release takes care of the following

 (1) There was a bug in the previous version of the utility.
     If back-ground init was going on one logical drive, then
     if the user tried to start check consistency/Init on some other
     logical drive, it was failing.

     [Reported By Rubina : 12-06-2002]
     Corrected in this release.


 (2) Added code to display the sync negotiated speed for the physical drive
     as per the new specs of Nov.14,2002 By Chayan Biswas

     Use Cmd 0xA4/2D to get target transfer speed for U320 adapters(518/520)
     instead of Enquiry3 cmd. If this command succeeds and gets valid data
     then give transfer speed in terms of MB/sec following SCSI standard in 
     physical drive info window. Otherwise, try getting the same information
     through Enquiry3 command as the utility did earlier.

     The variable for storing this information is changed to "ushort"
     from "uchar" to accomodate data for (320MB/sec.).


 (3) Disallow R0-spanning as it's useless.
     [Requested by Timir : 12-09-2002]


 (4) Disallow partial array spanning even in non random deletion
     supporting f/w path of the code.
     [It was already disallowed in random deletion supporting f/w path]

     Requested by Dougg : 12-09-2002.


 TESTING PERFORMED:
 ------------------
 Testing on actual hardware could not be done for change no.2
 (display sync negotiaton speed up to 320MB/sec due to lack of
 supporting hardware)

 Actual testing for remaining changes done on a system with one 493
 card on it.

Changes:
--------
     With respect to Ver 5.23 : Aug-28-2002

 (1) Made changes in the script(Dellmgr) to make it work on Red Hat
     Linux 8.0

 (2) The utility gives the user the option to view ongoing Init/CC
     preogress now.

     Affected Menus are :

     Managment Menu->Initialize->
     and 
     Managment Menu->Check Consistency->

     Now the bottom message also gives the option to the user to view
     ongoing Init/CC by pressing F6/F7 keys respectively.

     If no init/cc is going on, the message is given to the user.
     Once the user enters the viewwing of Init/CC, the "ESC" key
     has got the same functionality as in the normal init/cc menu.



Testing Done At Developer's End:
--------------------------------
 Testing  done on a 493 card. Started Init/CC and then exited the menu
 with out aborting the operation.

 Saw the Init/CC progress by pressing F6/F7 keys in Init/CC menu.

 Tested the utility on a Red Hat Linux 8.0 to see that the screen
 corruption issues are resolved and the utility works fine on it.

"Warning/error message is introduced in case of HSP making failed" in view/add configuration
 or Easy Configuration menu through F4 option in presence of "Rebuild or any other operation".
[In Previous Releases: After HSP is made thru F4 in these menus and  then exit - that did not 
give any "save y/n" option nor did it give any error message thus it was confusing user what 
happened to the action taken inside the menu].

 1.  Disallow disk spinup time option on IDE-1000 card.
 2.  Distinguish between Background Initialization and
     Check Consistency and display proper message if supported
     by firmware (0xA4/0x13 call).
     Corrected the non LD0 related bug.
 3.
     ShiftTab key was not available to the utility on Linux.
     So the bottom message for changing the rebuild rate is
     changed from

     "Use Tab/ShiftTab and Arrow Keys to increment/decrement the Rebuild Rate";

     to

     "Use Tab and Arrow Keys to increment/decrement the Rebuild Rate";

  4. At the time of creation of logical drive(s), the cursor display
     for changing the logical drive size was erratic. This was due
     to some issues with the "curses" function "move(x,y)". So the
     cursor is not displayed now.

  5. Resolved the coloring issue at the time of creation of
     logical drive(s). [Reported by BrianH]


  6. Utility supports MixMode Cluster.

  7. Removed the bug which was giving core dump while
     entering the "Reconstruction Menu" for ld==8.

1. ROMB related codes as modified for previous HP and Novell release are compiled under
   Linux OS and tested.
   The following features of ROMB are modified in this release
   a. It shows channel as "RAID Ch-x" or "SCSI Ch-x" (Channel on motherboard)
   In physical drive menu and configuration menus.

   b. Devices on SCSI Chnl( i.e.  channel on motherboard) have limited role
        to play as said below.
	-It cannot be configured as Hotspare or part of an array for logical 
         drives
        -It cannot take part for rebuild/reconstruction also.
        -Operations in physical drive menu are denied on SCSI Chnl devices
          * Make Hotspare     
          * Rebuild
          * Force Online/Offline
          * View rebuild progress
        -Capacity of Drives on SCSI Channel are shown as the actual SCSI 
         size(got from SCSI cmd 0x25) rounded to nearest MegaByte.
         Capacity of Drives on RAID channel are shown in COERCED mode as 
         before.


      
2.  Background Initialization/Consistency Checking is distinguished thru 0xA4/0x13 
    firmware command on eligible firmwares and distinctive message is shown during 
    selection of logical drive for Initialization/Consistency checking.

3. Bug Fix:
    a. Physical drive properties for "Error Counter" was showing wrong 
       values on some 8-ld cards because of wrong channel parameter 
       being passed to the firmware.
    b. "Number of logical drives" shown in "Logical Drives Configured-xx" 
       at some places were showing wrong values because of its improper 
       initialization .

 [1] Random Deletion support
 ---------------------------

 OBJECTIVE
   This release is targetted to support the firmware dated 7-31-01. Changes were made to conform to this firmware.
   This Dellmgr should work with "Deletetion of
   logical drive at random" and "successively re-use of the freed space for
   new logical drive" on eligible firmwares. Utilities will not have any 
   change on cards that do not support this "random logical drive
   deletion" feature. The following description just talks about the new
   firmware-relevant changes only.
   
   Old firmwares that do not have "random deletion" support will behave 
   normally under this new utility.
   

(1.1) CHANGES:
--------------
Changes needed: (include this part in release document)
   a) mailbox4 is made as 1 during firing of read config cmd on 40-ld card
   b) mailbox4 is made as 1 during firing of write config(add-config) cmd on 40-ld

 [1] Random Deletion support
 ---------------------------

 OBJECTIVE
   This release is targetted to support "Deletetion of
   logical drive at random" and "successively re-use of the freed space for
   new logical drive" on eligible firmwares. Utilities will not have any 
   change on cards that do not support this "random logical drive
   deletion" feature. The following description just talks about the new
   firmware-relevant changes only.
   
   Old firmwares that do not have "random deletion" support will behave 
   normally under this new utility.
   

(1.1) CHANGES:
--------------
   =>Configurable Array Selection Menu
     Create Logical Drive(thru EasyConfig/New Config/View AddConfig) on
   eligible firmware-fitted cards now has a new menu to show "configurable
   arrays" with free space in it.
   
     User selects the "array(s) to be configured"(thru <SPACE> key) and then
   presses <F10> key to configure it. The array(s) shown as configurable arrays
   are those that have one or more empty spaces. In "Easy Configuration" mode
   it allows selection of only one array at a time. Keys <F2> and <F3> show
   array elements(channel/Id) and Empty Space information respectively.
   
     If more than one arrays are selected - then these are configured as a 
   SPANNED logical drive with  "SPAN=YES" shown on next menu- that allows
   RAID,SIZE,ADVANCED,ACCEPT options.
   
    SPAN option in this menu is UNCHANGEABLE.
   
   SIZE option in this menu is changeable only if both the conditions are 
   met
     a) you are not in EASY CONFIGURAITON menu
     b) you have not selected more than one arrays for configuration.

   Note:
    Logical drive making logic on older firmware remain UNCHANGED
    
 => Deletion of a given logical drive(when there are more than 1-logical drive)
        On new random-deletion-supporting firmware, hitting <F5> key at
	Main->Objects->Logical Drive->Logical drive selection menu deletes
	only the selected logical drive.
	

 => Deletion of a given logical drive(when there is 1-logical drive)
	This is possible only by CLEAR CONFIGURATION operation as per 
	present design.
 
  
(1.2) RESTRICTIONS
------------------
  R1. Only one "free-slot" can be put from one given array to a given
      logical drive. One logical drive cannot have two "empty-slots" from
      same array.
  R2. "FreeSlots" of an array must be consumed in serial order i.e. lower
  	slot number must be configured first than next higher slot number.
  R3. It allows Spanning of R0 arrays as it was doing earlier(does not
      make any sense at all).
  R4. New Changes are effective only on firmware that support Random-deletion
      of logical drive.
  R5. "Automatic Configuration" is not supported on cards with random deletion
      supporting f/w on it. Utility gives this message if the user opts
      for this option on cards having random deletion supporting f/w
      on it.

(1.3) ISSUES:
-------------
  i1.  Old utilities(that did not support more than one hole and that too at
       the end of the last array) will misbehave in presence of multiple
       freeSlots in the array(s).

  [2] Supports IDE and normal PERC cards.
  ---------------------------------------
      Utility supports IDE as well as normal PERC cards.

 (2.1) Banner Shows something like
      IDE cards->
      "PERC Configuration Manager Ver 5.13(Jul 24,2001) (IDE)Adapter-x "

      Normal PERC cards->
      "PERC Configuration Manager Ver 5.13(Jul 24,2001)      Adapter-x "

 (2.2) On IDE cards, in physical drive showing menus, targets are denoted as
      'M'  (=> Denotes MASTER)
      'S'  (=> Denotes SLAVE)
      in place of ID 0 and ID 1
      In physical drive property showing box, MASTER and SLAVE is also
      displayed for MASTER and SLAVE respectively.


 (2.3) In physical drive property showing box, "Media/Other Erros" and
      "Predictive Failures" are not shown on IDE Raid Cards.

      For physical drives on IDE Raid cards, "SCSI Standards" 
      is displayed as
      SCSI Standards : N/A

 (2.4) Battery option is not supported for IDE Raid cards.

 (2.5) For IDE Raid Cards, if the user goes to SCSI Channel menu and hits
       ENTER, utility tells that this is not an option item for the adapter.

      Objects->SCSI Channel->

      "...Not An Option Item..."

 [3] Utility does not support ROMB.
 ---------------------------------
 ROMB support is dropped from the utility as per DELL's request.

 [4] MAX ARRAYS supported are 40.
 -------------------------------
 Utility supports maximum of 40 arrays now. Earlier it supported
 maximum of 60 arrays. This is done to be in sync with Control-m
 utility.




TESTING DONE AT DEVELOPER'S END:   Minimal nature.
  t1. Tested new features thru DEMO program that simulates different variety 
      of cards( the one that supports random logdrv deletion and that don't).
  t2. Tested "Array Configuration"/"Delete Logical Drive"/"Re-configure free
      plus did some basic menu-navigation testing.
  t3. IDE related testing done through demo utility.
      
      
TESTS SUGGESTED BY DEVELOPER:
-----------------------------
  => Rigorous testing with all the following resources present in the
     system.
       466,467,493(non random deletion firmware),493(with random deleteion fw).
  S.T.1) Configure a number of logical drives on 493(with random deletion fw)
  S.T.2) Delete a logical drive on it to make free slots in it
  S.T.3) Reconfigure the same array with 1 or more than free slots in it.
  S.T.4) Try rebuild/reconstruction operations on arrays that have more than
         one free slots in it.
  S.T.5) Try init/checkconsistency operations on arrays that have 
         more than one free slots in it.
  S.T.6) Look for spelling mistakes or any aesthetic issues
  S.T.7) Look for screen corruption issues - navigate maximum depths of 
          different menus and see if screen gets corrupted or not(like some
	  old stuff remains on screen of debug msg comes up etc).
  S.T.8) Change adapter number - back and forth and see if you face any data
  	 corruption/bugs etc.

   <C0>	No ROMB support in this. 
   <C1>	This release mainly attends the "logical drive making" bug -
	 If you try select non-default RAID level(from RAID-1 to RAID-0 or from
	 RAID-5 to Raid-0) in the Configuration Menu that shows 
	 "RAID=xx,Size=yyyyy,Advanced,Accept,Span options" - size calculation
	 was wrong and user was offered a smaller size than maximum possible
	 with RAID-0.
	 
	 This is cured. This bug is not present in "EvalVer 5.10a(ROMB)".

    <C2> Some "PINK color patch" issues resolved
    	Some color patches used to be left in Physical Drive related menus
	(Configuration menus and Physical drive menu).
	e.g.
	   Main Menu->New Config Menu -> Select some drives and try to
	    configure
	    It will take to you menu with options 
			 	"RAID-xx Size=xxxxxx,Advanced,Accept.."
	    Select Size option - and deliberately input wrong value as size
	    It will come up with some message "Invalid size" etc and then used
	    to leave some "Pink patch" on some column .

	 This is cured.

	Similar type of "coloured patch" was visible in Physical drive menu
	Select a drive->Hit ENTER-> Try some invalid operation on this drive
	-so that utility gives some message such as "No Rebuild Allowed on 
	this drive" or "This operation is not allowed on this drive" etc.
	
	It used to leave PINK PATCH . This patch does not come any more.

    <C3> "Force Offline" option changed to "Force Offline/Remove HSP"
	    as per DELL's Philip FU's instruction .
	    Its help is changed from
      
      	"Configure Physical Drive State As OFFLINE"
			to 
      "Change Physical Drive State from ONLINE to FAILED or HOTSPARE to READY"

     <C4>  Supports 60-arrays( 5.10 release supported 40)
     
 TEST REPORT:
 	Tested the above fix on a 428-card(PERC) with 2-drives on it 
	on RedHat 6.2.

		to configure the devices on SCSI chnls.
	   2.3. All devices ( SCSI + RAID Chnl ) are shown in physical drive 
	        menu.
	        Following options are not allowed for devices on SCSI Chnl.
		      (a)Make Hotspare		(d) Rebuild
		      (b)Force Online		(e) View Rebuild Progress
		      (c)Force Offline
	   2.4. Actual SCSI Size(to nearest MB) is shown for SCSI Drives on 
	        SCSI-CHANNEL.
		
		For drives on RAID CHANNEL, it shows COERCED size.

	   2.5. In physical drive showing menu, RAID chnls are shown as
	        "RAID Ch-X" and SCSI Chnls are shown as "SCSI Ch-X".

	C3. "Force Offline" option changed to "Force Offline/Remove HSP"
	    as per DELL's Philip FU's instruction .
	    Its help is changed from
      
      	"Configure Physical Drive State As OFFLINE"
			to 
      "Change Physical Drive State from ONLINE to FAILED or HOTSPARE to READY"

	C4. Supports upto 60-arrays( earlier 40) .

 BUG FIX:
   B1. In the recent enhancement related to "Logical Drive Size" in new 
       Logical Drive making( the menu that shows "RAID-x,Size-yyyy,Advanced 
       menu,Accept,.." options ), there was a bug - if you change the RAID 
       level, the drive size allowed was less than maximum possible.

	The bug was reported by DELL on 5-21-01 via PeterJ.
	This is Corrected .

 TESTING:
         Testing was done on a 493 card with "ROMB" Test f/w on it.

[ Ver 5.09 : Jan 29,2001 : AmitP]
{
 Changes:
 --------
          (With respect to ver 5.08 : Jan 26,2001)

          1. There was a bug in 5.08 in battery backup option.
             Removed the bug in this release.

          2. Script dellmgr is in UNIX format now.

             (in 5.08 it was in DOS format)

             CARE MUST BE TAKEN NOT TO EDIT THE SCRIPT ON DOS SYSTEM.
             ELSE IT WILL BE CONVERTED TO DOS FORMAT.

 File Details:
 --------------
               This release contains two files.

               (a) dellmgr    : Script (    690 bytes)
               (b) dellmgr.bin: Binary (513,044 bytes)
      

 TEST REPORT:
 ------------
               Only changes related testing done on a system with
               one 438 & one 493 card on it.

               Further testing is suggested.

[ DELL : Ver 5.08 : Jan 26,2001 : AmitP]
{
 Changes:
 --------
          (With respect to ver 5.07 : Oct 30,2000)

          1. Utility made compliant to new driver specifications
             Ver 1.14B (as provided by VenkateshR)

             (Document : Specification for Linux Application Rev 1.1/1.2)

             Now the utility uses the MIMD IOCTL interface to talk
             with the driver/firmware.

             Old SCSI IOCTL interface is not supported now.

          2. Utility comes in a form of a script now.
             The script takes care of creation of node and after that
             it calls the actual binary.

             This release contains two files.

             (a) dellmgr (script) (b) dellmgr.bin (binary)

             Both of these should be present in the same directory
             for invocation.

             Change the execute permissions of script & binary by:

             chmod +x ./dellmgr
             chmod +x ./dellmgr.bin

             And then invoke utility as:

             ./dellmgr 

          3. Driver version 1.14 or above is a must to run the utility.
             If lower version of driver is used, utility gives the message
             and quits.

          4. Configuration options:
             ----------------------
             Automatic Configuration
             Easy Configuration
             New Configuration
             View/Add Configuration
             Clear Configuration
             ----------------------

             are supported in the utility now.

         5.  Logical drive size - Once selected could not be increased in
             New logical drive configuration menu.
             Changed this feature to allow to reselect the free available
             space at will.

             i.e.

             Logical drive size selection field in NewLogicalDriveConfiguration
             menu is enhanced to allow user-mistake-and-go-back-to-leftover
             -size-of the array.
	   
             e.g. 
             If a logical array has 2000MB and user selects 100MB as size   
             and again changes mind(before hitting ACCEPT option) and goes
             back to size option to make it bigger than 100MB - it used to
             give an error "Invalid logical drive size..." with older megamgr.
             This is now allowed.


         6.  Earlier, a card was considered to be a 493Lite, if all of
             the below conditions were true:

             (a) Card is 40Ld     (b) Card is 493
             (c) Card does not have a battery charge circuit
             (d) Card is in DELL's  SABRE system.

             Now apart from this, card is considered to be 493Lite/TaosLite
             if all of these conditions are true:

             (a)Card is 40Ld     (b) Card is 493
             (c)TaosLite flag is set to ON on the card.


             So a 493 is displayed as PERC 3/DCL if any one of the above
             set of conditions is true.

             Otherwise, 493 is displayed as PERC 3/DC.



 File Details:
 --------------
               This release contains two files.

               (a) dellmgr    : Script (    957 bytes)
               (b) dellmgr.bin: Binary (513,012 bytes)
      

 TEST REPORT:
 ------------
               Tested the utility on a system with

               a.  one 471 & one 493 card

               b.  one 471 & one 438 card

               c.  one 471, one 493 & one 438 card


               (Driver Version 1.14B)

               Tried to test with 428 card, but the driver gives core
               dump while doing "insmod".

               --------------------------------------------------------
               Utility Checks for driver version(which is in form of
               decimal). If the driver version is lower than 1.14, it
               gives the messages and quits.

               Utility is not tested with Version 1.14A of driver.
               
               --------------------------------------------------------

               Further testing is suggested.

{
 Changes:
     -with 493Lite specific support as mentioned below as per email from
     ahmad_ali@dell.com of 9-14-2000.
 Changes made in this release: (with respect to ver 5.03 )
        1. No option to see battery status for 493Lite card
	2. Default writepolicy WRTHRU for new ld  for 493Lite card
	3. Double prompt warning when WriteBack is opted during/after ld
	   creation for 493Lite card.
	4. Adapter type shown by utility as "PERC 3/DCL" for 493Lite

Who's 493Lite ?
 	Who meets all the following 3-conditions
	1. 	If the card is a 493 card
	2. 	If it does not have battery( BatteryStatus.Bit0 set )
	3.	If it is in SABER system

Who is Saber System:(per email 9-14-00 from Ahmad_ali@dell.com)
	A Host with 'Dell System' string in the area 0xF000:0 to 0xF000:FFFF 
	and no string 'Precision' in the area 0xF000:0 to 0xF000:FFFF and
	that has a byte at 0xF000:0xE845 as 0xDA( PowerApp) or 0xDF( PowerEdge).

	DOS Megamgr searches the F000-FFFF to find if it's a SABER system 
	or not.
	
	Non-DOS megamgr depends on BIOS for its decision making about Saber
	system identification - BIOS keeps the SystemIdentification 
	information in the BIOSPvtArea and non-DOS utilities use that for
	decision making - utilities check BIOS version to be ">=" "3x08" to
	avoid "unplugging of NVRAM" from one board and plugging into other
	board with different BIOS .
	
	So if the card is not fitted with a BIOS version "3x08" and/or above
	it will not be considered for 493Lite( as Bios ver 3.08 and above will
	follow the above mentioned scheme ).

	AMI's 727-series motherboard.
	Nothing beyond that.

 -Make Hotspare is now working. Earlier it was crashing.

 -Reconstruction progress reporting had some bug(in case of reconstruction
  error it could show some wrong info ) - corrected .

 -Searching Adapter phase shows a message and a revolving 'swing' if there is
  lot of delays in it.
  This is more evident if you run megamgr in absence of the driver.

 -Running megamgr in absence of driver was unnecessarily allowing entry to
  main menu and then exiting. Corrected in this.

 -The utility is using now STATIC library to avoid linker issue (with dynamic
  /shared libararies ) under different Linux flavors.

 -It now Locks the firmware cmd's data area for ioctl protocol for its 
  memory use by the driver as per recommendation from driver developer
  ( Venkatesh of AMI-India).

 -It allows the utility to be executed by super user only.

{
 LIST OF CHANGES:
	1. Color related improvement for speed and esthetics.
	   It speeds up the overall execution of 40-ld megamgr	
	2. Correction made for progress bars of init/rbldrate menu.
	3. Correction made for color/display of Horizontal Bar in phys 
	   drive menu
	4. Configuration Option is no more available 
	5. Make On/Off line : phys drv option shows drive number now in
		Decimal if it's not on fiber chnl
		in Hex  along with 'h' suffix if it's on fiber chnl
	   This will be effective in all future megamgrs automatically.

	6. Show cursor position alwyas in physical drive menu to indicate 
	        the current physical drive. This helps in a situation where
		coloring/highlighting is not that much prominent.
	  This is right now enabled for Linux version - it can be extended to
	  other OS also.

	7. Show Warning message in the Linux path on  selection of
	    FAIL-Drive/Online drive in phys drive menu.

	    Earlier these were offed in pwin.c file.

	    Co-ordinates of 'confirmation window(Y/N)' are also changed to
	    accommodate these changes.
	    In case of "NO" option selected by user it comes back to prev
