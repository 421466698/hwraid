adaptec-universal-storage-snmpd for Debian
==========================================

Required SNMPd configuration
----------------------------

After installing this package, some additional configuration is required to
connect it to snmp daemon.

Please add the following lines /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:
  master agentx
  agentxsocket /var/agentx/master

Then you need to enable aus-snmpd. Set ENABLE to true in
  /etc/default/adaptec-universal-storage-snmpd

You can now restart both snmpd and adaptec-universal-storage-snmpd services.

All information can be read by running (may depends of your SNMPd config):
  snmpwalk -v2c -c public -m ADAPTEC-UNIVERSAL-STORAGE-MIB 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.795

You SHOULD really install adaptec-universal-storage-mib package to get
"human-readable" information.

Starting Squeeze release, Debian doesn't include default snmpb mibs anymore.
Please install "snmp-mibs-downloader" package.
