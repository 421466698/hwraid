3dm2 for Debian
----------------

3DM2 is listening on <https://127.0.0.1:888/> as default.
Please note that, for evident security reason, it's not available from any
remote computer.
You can change this behavior by modifying /etc/3dm2/3dm2.conf and by setting
RemoteAccess to 1. After modifying the value, please, do restart the service.

Default passwords for both user and administrator are '3ware'.
PLEASE CHANGE THESE PASSWORDS *BEFORE* ENABLING REMOTE ACCESS !
